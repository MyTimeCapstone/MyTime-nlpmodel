"Clients in the Memory Visiting Program are in need of someone to remind them that they do matter, and to remind them of why they matter. Ask about their interests and their abilities and then use this week after week to guide your conversations and activities.
Youâ€™ll provide a friendly social connection outside of the clientâ€™s normal social sphere and engage the client in activities or conversations that appeal to the clientâ€™s unique interests and abilities. This may involve looking at family photos, going out for a walk or simply sharing coffee and conversation.
Youâ€™ll also be giving the family caregiver(s) a short break â€“ a very important part of the support youâ€™re providing.
Training is available to assist you in supporting your client. The training includes suggested activities and strategies you can use to engage your client. Plus, our Care Managers are always available to support you and your client.

"Volunteers always needed for lonely, isolated Seniors - some who do not speak English.
One visit per week can bring a lonely Senior a huge sense of worth and happiness. Seniors who are isolated, often  their recall of daily details is frosted over. A little social contact can melt that ice and bring warmth to you and your new Senior Friend.
Visit a socially isolated Senior in their own home. You can provide sunshine by making a new friend with a client who is still very social, friendly and happy to see you but is experiencing challenges with their memory. Many are still very physically able.
Visits are weekly for as little as one-hour time commitment for an in-home visit or a couple of hours if you care to take them to an activity in which you share an interest such as coffee, shopping, attend an art show, live music, even for a walk by the lake. By volunteering, you may also be providing some much-needed support to a caregiver or family member simply by visiting one of our wonderful clients.
